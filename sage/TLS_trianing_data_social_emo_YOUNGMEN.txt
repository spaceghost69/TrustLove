ChatGPT
Navigating trust issues, especially when past experiences have left you feeling wary, is indeed challenging. Your situation with the woman you're communicating with illustrates the complexities of trust and communication in relationships. Here are some steps to consider in handling this situation and the broader challenge of trust:
Addressing the Current Situation:
		Honesty: Consider being honest with her about why you canceled the reservation. People often appreciate honesty, and it could set a foundation for a more open and trusting interaction going forward.
		Understanding: Realize that everyone has their own pace and reasons for communication. Sometimes what might seem like ghosting could be due to other factors in a person's life.
		Rebuilding: If you're still interested in connecting with her, suggest an alternative plan or a new time to meet up. It shows your willingness to make amends and gives you both another chance to connect.
Dealing with Trust Issues:
		Self-Reflection: Reflect on your past experiences and try to understand how they are influencing your current reactions. Are there patterns or triggers that you can identify?
		Communication: In future interactions, strive for clear and open communication. Express your feelings and concerns honestly, and encourage others to do the same.
		Setting Boundaries: Understand your boundaries and communicate them to others. Boundaries help in building healthy and trusting relationships.
		Taking Risks: Trust involves a certain level of risk-taking. While it's important to be cautious, allowing yourself to take small, calculated risks in trusting others can lead to rewarding relationships.
		Professional Guidance: If trust issues are significantly impacting your relationships, consider seeking support from a counselor or therapist. They can provide strategies and support to help you navigate these challenges.
		Patience with Yourself: Building trust takes time, especially when you've been hurt before. Be patient with yourself and acknowledge your efforts to build trust, even when it's difficult.
Trust is a fundamental aspect of human relationships, and rebuilding it after being hurt can be a slow and delicate process. It's about finding the right balance between protecting yourself and being open to new connections and experiences. Remember, each interaction and relationship is a new opportunity to learn and grow.




It happened before when confirming with someone new and they did not get back to me “timely” when i expected

ChatGPT
It sounds like you've encountered a pattern where your expectations around communication timing aren't being met, leading to uncertainty and discomfort. This is a common challenge in new relationships or interactions, where different people have different communication styles and expectations. Here are some strategies to navigate this in the future:
Understanding Communication Styles:
		Diverse Expectations: Recognize that people have varying habits and expectations regarding communication. What seems timely to one person may not be the same for another.
		Expressing Preferences: Early in a new relationship or interaction, it can be helpful to share your communication preferences and inquire about theirs. This helps set mutual expectations.
Building Trust and Patience:
		Giving Benefit of the Doubt: When someone doesn't respond as quickly as you hope, try to give them the benefit of the doubt. They may be busy, dealing with personal issues, or simply have a different sense of timing.
		Cultivating Patience: Practice patience while waiting for responses. Engage in activities or tasks that keep you occupied and help reduce anxiety about waiting.
Handling Uncertainty:
		Plan B: In situations like making reservations or planning dates, have a backup plan. For instance, choose a place where a last-minute change won’t cause much inconvenience.
		Clear Communication: If timing is crucial (e.g., for reservations), communicate this clearly. Let them know that you need confirmation by a certain time for planning purposes.
Reflecting on Personal Reactions:
		Self-Reflection: Consider why delayed responses make you anxious. Is it past experiences, fear of rejection, or something else? Understanding this can help you respond more calmly in the future.
		Learning from Experiences: Use these experiences as learning opportunities. Reflect on what went well and what could be improved in your communication and reaction.
Seeking Balance:
		Balancing Caution and Openness: While it’s important to protect yourself from potential hurt, also consider the possibility of positive outcomes. Finding a balance between caution and openness can lead to more fulfilling interactions.
		Professional Advice: If you find that these patterns are significantly impacting your ability to form new relationships, speaking with a therapist can provide additional strategies and insights.
Each new interaction is an opportunity to apply what you've learned from past experiences. Over time, you'll likely find a communication rhythm that works for you, leading to more satisfying and less stressful interactions. Remember, building connections often involves a degree of trial and error, and that's perfectly okay.




Damnit sometimes or maybe always i am my own worst enemy. I also wonder if trying to do music is a mistake although i made my first really marketable song yesterday i was very excited. However it is based on a very cliche piano chords and i am still unable to figure out a vocal approach so it’s instrumentals.

ChatGPT
It's not uncommon to feel like you are your own worst critic, especially when exploring creative pursuits like music. Remember, every artist goes through periods of self-doubt and questioning. Here are some thoughts to consider as you navigate your musical journey:
Embracing the Creative Process:
		Value of Experimentation: Creativity often involves experimenting, trying new things, and sometimes feeling uncertain. Every attempt, whether successful or not, is a step forward in your creative journey.
		Cliché Can Be Good: Many popular and beloved songs are built on simple, even cliché chord progressions. What makes a song stand out is often how you add your unique touch to it.
		Instrumentals Are Valid: Instrumental music can be deeply expressive and impactful. Not every song needs vocals to be complete or marketable.
Overcoming Self-Doubt:
		Self-Compassion: Be kind to yourself. Creative work is challenging, and being overly critical can hinder your progress and enjoyment.
		Small Wins: Celebrate your achievements, like completing your first marketable song. It’s a significant milestone!
		Learning Mindset: View each challenge as a learning opportunity. If you're struggling with vocals, consider it an area for growth and exploration, not a failure.
Exploring Vocal Approaches:
		Vocal Experimentation: Try different vocal styles or techniques. Sometimes, the right approach takes time to discover.
		Collaboration: Consider collaborating with a singer or vocal artist. They can bring new dimensions to your music.
		Vocal Training: If you're interested in adding your own vocals, consider some training or workshops to develop your skills and confidence.
Balancing Creativity and Doubt:
		Feedback and Support: Share your work with trusted friends or fellow musicians for constructive feedback. External perspectives can be enlightening and encouraging.
		Personal Fulfillment: Focus on what making music brings to you personally. Is it joy, a sense of achievement, a way to express yourself? Keeping this in mind can help navigate the ups and downs.
		Professional Guidance: If self-doubt and criticism are significantly impacting your life, a therapist or counselor can provide strategies to manage these feelings.
Remember, every artist's journey is unique. Doubts and challenges are part of the process. Embrace your path, continue to explore and learn, and most importantly, enjoy the process of creating music. Your unique voice and perspective are valuable contributions to the world of music.
