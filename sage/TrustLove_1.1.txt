To My Mom: my first teacher and giver of love.
Prologue

An Intro : Trust in Love
The term “TrustLove” is probably a new term for a concept that you already know. It’s a thing you have experienced  whether you know it or not. The first eye contact between parent and newborn .. an incredible connection of love … and an incredible extension of trust. Much like remembering the heartbeat of the womb, somewhere deep inside is this memory, of bonding with your parents, the deep knowledge that you can trust, that you are safe and cared for. Sometimes these some ideas emerge through an intuitive process t

In my case the words Trust Love emerged randomly as I was seeking a phrase to grace my bedroom wall with an LED light. I wanted a pithy phrase that summed up a feeling I had been having lately, more of a need deep within.

After a long rocky marriage and as a newly single person in 2023, I began my journey to date again and meet new people.

So as I stood there brainstorming for a cozy wall hung decorative lighting idea… a deeper narrative rose up in the form of this phrase that I had been telling myself, lately… a phrase that had popped into my head one day as I was contemplating a minor broken heart — a phrase devoted to continuously being open to love even when we know it can and probably will cause us pain… but this phrase was my mantra to not be overly self-protective and closed with new people… the phrase was “Trust Love”.

Sure enough, this made a great choice for the LED lighting.

But as I lived with this idea, it became more weighty over time. I see this phrase now as a vital entreaty to us all, a suggestion, guidance, advice, and a touchstone that cannot be denied.

You see these 2 words are very connected.  Love is the energy, feeling, intention… but Trust is the conduit, the ability, the non-transactional form of reciprocity you receive from unconditional love.

Your lover looks in your eyes and there is love and also there is ALSO trust. It is a question and an answer, a knowing and a comfort that you can trust in this love.

The look is there with your children and your pets. Dogs especially, with their expressive eyes, can display trust as they ‘look to you’ for every next move.

And I will never forget the look of love and trust from my son minutes after he was born, till this very day.

You must trust someone enough to let them love you. You must trust in the ability of love itself to heal, and to be “enough”.

Trust is earned by those that speak and live their Truth. Truth and Trust are formed of the same idea that requires the trustworthy to honor a commitment to love justice and others sometimes above oneself.

Trust is earned by those that sacrifice in the service of their love of others.

The strength we have that allows us to love others and to love our communities and families all depends upon trust in one another.

It’s hard to imagine love existing without trust — I have not seen it. Without the security and faith we derive from the knowledge of our own lovability, and the trust we have in our belief in the capacity for love itself to change the universe.

You can even love the “unlovable” because you trust in their inherent goodness. Or even just in the goodness of extending your love, itself an act of willing “good” into existence.

Those that pray for their enemies fall in this category.


This book is an invitation to join a journey of exploration and understanding — a journey that delves into the beauty and intricacies of existence, the rhythmic cycles that govern it, and the powerful, transcendental nature of love that underlies everything.





Chapter 1


3 Pillars
As I sit in the quietude of a serene evening, my thoughts wander through the vast expanse of the cosmos, guided by the rhythmic breathing of my white Labrador nestled comfortably in my lap. In this moment of domestic tranquil companionship, a realization dawns on me about the undeniable personality gleaming in her gentle eyes. 

Our bond, simple yet profound, is a testament to the pure and wonderful force of nature that is love. This connection, transcending words and species, serves as a gateway to the TrustLove philosophy—a philosophy born from the intertwining of everyday wonders with the grand mysteries of the universe.

It's here, in the simplest acts of affection and loyalty, that I find the essence of a truth so deep and vast it mirrors the dance of the stars and the enigmatic whispers of the quantum realm. The TrustLove philosophy is not just a set of ideas; it's a living, breathing journey that begins in the heart and expands to embrace the entire cosmos.

The Void
"In the second revelation of the TrustLove philosophy, we confront a stark yet vital truth: it is not merely the presence of love that shapes our existence, but poignantly, its absence. 

This void, a chasm of alienation from the nurturing 'mother spirit' and the protective embrace of the 'father protector', becomes the crucible of much human suffering. 

As we traverse the streets shadowed by the hushed despair of addiction, we witness a poignant illustration of this loss. Here, the addicts, adrift on the sidewalks, embody a desperate search for acceptance and meaning—a search born from the profound absence of love in their lives. 

The temporary solace found in substances is but a fleeting illusion, a simulacrum of the love they yearn for, artificially triggering the brain's oxytocin and dopamine responses. 

Chapter 5 delves into the heart-wrenching reality that when severed from love, the human spirit embarks on a harrowing odyssey, yearning for a semblance of the connection it has lost. It is a journey that underscores the transcendental nature of love and its indispensable role in our quest for wholeness and meaning."

From Many: One
Chapter 8 takes an uncomfortable look at some of “the Cycles” and how low-trust and low-empathy societies combine to provide a breeding ground for tyranny and war.

There is an echo not only of the cycles but of the theme of bio mimicry, of a mirror-like balance, of a sort of intricate repetition of patterns and phenomena from the ultra small to the ultra macro.

Much as individuals are at one scale a collection of single-celled organisms, acting collectively towards the goal of sentient life, and at another scale an individual part of a much larger society of similar beings acting collectively as expressed in “culture”, “history”, and “events”.

These cultures then reflect the collective neurosis and dysfunction of the individuals therein.  This is self-evident in the “sick” societies of Nazi Germany for example. Extreme example of collective lack of empathy and love, the hatred of unloved young men being channeled successfully by a tyrant. 

Section II: The Poignant Void of Love's Absence**

Venturing into the second profound revelation of TrustLove, we confront a stark and vital truth: our existence is profoundly shaped not just by the presence of love but, more significantly, by its absence. As we walk through the shadows of city streets, the poignant struggles of the addicts we encounter paint a vivid picture of this absence. Their lives, overshadowed by the relentless pursuit of fleeting comfort, mirror a deep yearning for a lost connection — a profound search for meaning and acceptance in the absence of genuine love. Their plight is a stark reminder of the love they desperately seek, a love that once flourished but is now lost. This narrative powerfully underscores the transcendent nature of love and its indispensable role in our collective journey toward healing, understanding, and meaning.

**Section III: From Individual to Collective — The Mirror of Society**

In TrustLove, we observe a theme of biomimicry, a balance mirrored from the smallest of cells to the grandest of societal constructs. At one scale, each individual is a collective symphony of single-celled organisms, harmoniously striving towards the goal of sentient existence. At another, we are but a singular note in the larger symphony of society, our actions and thoughts contributing to the broader narrative of culture, history, and events. 

These societal structures, in turn, reflect the collective psyche of their constituent individuals. This is evident in the societal ailments of eras marked by collective neurosis and dysfunction, such as the harrowing epoch of Nazi Germany. These dark periods in history serve as extreme examples of a society's collective empathy deficit, where the unchanneled hatred and pain of unloved individuals were exploited by tyrannical forces.


Chapter 2: Universal Genesis Theory



The Cosmic Architect and Understanding the Universe's Design

The Universal Genesis Theory posits that the universe is a meticulously designed construct, akin to a grand machine or an intricate work of art. This theory suggests that the universe is not a random occurrence but a deliberate creation by entities with god-like capabilities and intentions.

Sentient Creator of the Cosmos

These creators, often conceptualized as advanced beings or even as a form of advanced collective consciousness, are hypothesized to have engineered the universe to foster life and consciousness. This concept challenges traditional views of creation, offering a perspective that bridges science fiction with deep spiritual insights.

Humanity's Role in the Cosmic Design

Within this framework, humanity is seen as one of many species competing and living out the script of the EVOLUTION PROGRAM.  The rise of ever-increasingly advanced species is the integral purpose of the universe's design. Our consciousness and ability to understand the universe are not mere accidents but essential aspects of this grand design, a prerequisite  to winning the game of evolution is understanding it.

“You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no commandment greater than this.”
— Mark 12:31
 



Chapter 3: The Cycles



The ‘Music of the Spheres’ and Historical Perspectives

The concept of the 'music of the spheres' speaks to an ancient philosophical notion that celestial bodies – planets and stars – create a form of music through their movements in space. This 'music' isn't audible in a conventional sense but represents a harmonious, mathematical precision in the universe. 

Historically, this idea, spanning cultures from Pythagoras to Kepler, symbolizes a cosmic order. It suggests that just as musical notes create harmony, celestial movements follow a rhythmic, predictable pattern, contributing to the universal symphony.

The Integral Tie to Music
Music, in its essence, is a manifestation of waveforms and vibrations, deeply connected to the rhythms of nature and the cosmos. Just as planets orbit in elliptical patterns, creating waves over time, musical notes and rhythms emerge from oscillations, resonating with our most primal experiences. 


The heartbeat of a mother, the first sound heard in the womb, is our initial encounter with rhythmic pulsation, echoing throughout our lives as a comforting, familiar pattern. This innate connection to rhythmic patterns may explain why music, in all its forms, holds such a profound and often inexplicable place in human experience.

While science has delved into the acoustics and psychology of music, its impact on the human spirit remains largely enigmatic. We resonate with music’s synchronous pulses, perhaps because they echo the very essence of life, from the heartbeat in the womb to the cyclical patterns of nature. 

Music's ability to evoke emotions, trigger memories, and even alter consciousness points to its profound, yet not fully understood, influence.

Music and Universal Cycles
The idea of music as a reflection of universal cycles extends beyond auditory experiences to encompass political, geological, and social rhythms. Just like music, these domains experience periods of harmony and discord. Political upheavals, geological shifts, and social changes can be seen as parts of a vast, interconnected symphony. Each element, with its unique waveform and cycle, contributes to the grand composition of existence. This perspective allows us to view life’s challenges and triumphs as part of a larger, dynamic orchestration, where moments of discord are as integral as those of harmony, creating a rich tapestry of human and universal experience.

Conclusion
Incorporating the music of the spheres and the understanding of music as a phenomenon rooted in the deepest layers of existence offers a profound way to comprehend the cycles of life. TrustLove, embracing this philosophy, can see the interconnectedness of all things, finding music not just in sound, but in every aspect of the cosmos, from the microcosm of human emotions to the macrocosm of celestial movements. This chapter underscores the belief that life, in all its forms, is a symphony, sometimes harmonious, sometimes chaotic, but always resonating with the fundamental rhythms of the universe.

Sentient Creator of the Cosmos




Chapter 4: The Observer



The nature of consciousness

The role of consciousness in the universe is a bit of a mystery to put it mildly.

The nature of consciousness itself is questionable. There is a sense of continuity to it, a sense that the self state is the same when we awaken as the one we fell asleep to.

But if there is a purpose to consciousness, it would be something about being able to navigate existence in the multidimensional world.

In terms of the UGT and perhaps the Cycles however, this phenomena of consciousness would perhaps be just one attribute of the various species evolving across the cosmos.

Surely some alien species would have quite a different “experience” of aliveness… or so we might assume. Perhaps conscious “aliveness” feels similarly and is common across the galaxy and beyond.

We are not yet in a position to know these answers, however the idea that consciousness serves a higher purpose is supported interestingly by many world religions.

In fact much of Christian scripture is concerned with the straight up worship and idolization of an all-powerful creator. The call to appreciate, to witness, to feel the power and the glory… it’s quite explicit in these texts.

So this idea that perhaps our witness, our observational capacity is the very point of consciousness in an important way by witnessing our world no matter how large or small our perspective, we are a collective consciousness in the sense we are all part of the same physical universe, and in that regard we ARE the consciousness, the eyes, ears, nose and awestruck monkey brain of the cosmos.

“THE OBSERVER”

What is this role called? Well I would not have really coined a term in fact I was not going to include this idea in TrustLove at all initially.

For me, and this is where shit gets weird to be honest, I had this thought in my head completely isolated from any of this context, in fact September 14, 2019 literally just as the COVID-19 pandemic was getting started.

My mother-in-law’s boyfriend owned a beautiful vineyard in the northern end of the Pope Valley in Napa. Luckily for our family we got to stay in his farmhouse every now and again on the weekend.

On this one particular (and last) trip up there, it was a year after my mother-in-law’s tragic death from lung cancer. We were celebrating her life and taking time out to show each other our love for her.

The opportunity was also created by Bob (the vineyard owner) to heal a family wound between myself John McMahon and my Sister In Law, Dana.

I am always interested in healing relationships — I was there to make peace and show family love. Unfortunately Dana did not show up that weekend. It was a huge disappointment to me as I knew the family pain would only continue (it got much worse actually… but that’s already covered elsewhere)

All of this is backstory to the event that unfolded that evening at just before 10pm.

I was standing alone by the pond. Most vineyards in Napa have ponds to store for irrigation during the hot dry summer months. Bob’s was a good one, with a beautiful home and a small island jutting out it was a perfect place to catch fish as someone had once loaded the pond with trout which still thrived in the limited water, somehow making it work.

I stood alone, the rest of the family had gone to bed and I had a bit of energy yet, I went out to the edge of the pond for some quiet reflection. The days events were on my mind, the unresolved bitterness with Dana a nagging thought, the loss of Marion to cancer and the finality of this event — Bob was Marion’s boyfriend and she was forever gone, we were friendly but Bob had his own grown kids and to be honest we all knew this visit would be the last. None of us knew about the pandemic that would soon follow, or the massive fires that tore into the region and came within feet of where I stood that night, fierce destruction was so close at hand.

So the scene was laid out before me, complete quietude overcame me, a sense of complete peace. The scene was beautiful and incredibly serene. No wind, it was a warm September evening, dry and yet calm after the evening breeze had settled down.

I stood there looking up at this epic bright full moon, and the stars which would have been extremely bright this far from the city lights, but for the moon in its blazing glory coming right up over the valley.

It shall surprise no reader that I took a moment to reflect philosophically on all of this, my life, my problems and the recent death and inherent loss and change of life, yet here I stood witnessing this glory of the cosmos and being privileged to experience the beauty and awe of nature (and thus the Cycles as I would later piece together)

The privilege part seemed obvious but there was a subtle and not altogether pleasant subtext of witness. That I was also there to witness.

It was a very calm moment, where I stood finally my mind coming to a more restful state this meditative beauty before me and some real peace and quiet. I was “witnessing” myself … conscious of my self in this moment in this tiny corner of this vast thing that I could clearly see before me. The reality of it was enough. Nothing could be denied. In fact yes I literally was (and am) a tiny consciousness in a vast endless expanse of wonder. It is as true now for you reading this as it was for me that night.

But that night had one more lesson for me. Perhaps a gift. As I sat there contemplating my “witnessing” and appreciating the beauty of the rising full moon and the cool shades of blues and greens and grays of the surrounding moon-lit valley before me, a singular, crystalline phrase popped right into my mind.

THE OBSERVER

Well, ok, cool. I thought. Yea that is absolutely what I am right now. 

I had a weird idea that “the observer” is consciousness of a certain “level” that provides the universe with the ability to perceive itself, in addition this connectedness to a higher purpose of the observer creates a sensation in the person/being doing the observing… it creates the feeling of AWE, exactly BECAUSE this act of perceiving beauty is itself a higher order function of the cosmos.

DAMN that was a cool idea. I was so moved at the time I took a photo of the scene with my iPhone knowing full well a night shot directly at a full moon was not going to make a great photo. I took the photo to memorialize this occasion as I knew something bigger was going on.  I sat with this idea of “the observer” for quite some time.

As the pandemic progressed, as life went on, sure enough we never went back to Bob’s vineyard, and as other chapters will cover, my marriage and family life shattered thereafter and in 2022 I found myself back as a single man, with 50% custody and 50% assets and some time on my hands to rebuild my life and reflect on all of this …

As it happens this leads to recent days as I have been working through many of my OTHER philosophical ideas namely UGT, the Cycles, and TrustLove philosophy… 

So to be honest I had not really been able to synthesize the Observer into these conceptual models it was sort of an outlier event in my mind and was not really trying to. I was thinking I would mention it as an interesting aside, or bring it up in interviews who knows…

But then something wild happened.

December 2023, I had just begun to get excited about how this also gave me a much needed artists persona to pursue my music.

As I was working with ChatGPT on the TrustLove philosophy,
I’m not a graphic artist, having done at most some layout and design work for websites and apps over the years, and couple of print ads for my startup Extentech.

So one area that I was leaning on DALL-E and Midjourney for was in coming up with graphical ideas, brainstorming and generating a vision for what this whole TrustLove thing was all about.

The music part was well underway and I had a few songs produced and was looking for some quick and dirty ideas for album art. This is a great use case because I can get a vibe or vision done but in a way I cannot visualize on my own.

So as I sat down that night to play around with some album art ideas, I have to admit I was having fun and DALL-E was coming up with some great stuff.

But as I continued, over and over there was a sort of theme emerging and it was a bit unnerving once I realized it.

At first I did not even notice it or make a connection… but sure enough, these album art covers were starting to show me something… familiar…

Many of the tiles depicted a moon or cosmic scene at the end of a valley or perhaps avenue of skyscrapers in a more urban take… but the distinct geometry of the scene was quite repetitive and unmistakeable… it was the same scene from the vineyard 5 years prior — a figure sometimes with others sometimes alone, standing at the end of the valley before the cosmic scene often across water, of the sky and the heavens above.

Many of the most remarkable had diagrammatic tracings in the sky as if to illustrate the cycles in the heavens, as if the figure could see these cycles and patterns.

I noticed the pattern and immediately got a bit unsettled. The uncanny valley was being shown back to me… my own life being shown back to me in imagery … from 5 years ago.

Now the obvious question is did I feed I this imagery somehow? Definitely not directly. I have gone over the chat text many times and nothing to suggest that DALL-E should draw mostly valleys with cosmic scenes on one end and figures on the other…

How universal even is this vision? I cannot speak to that but something was going on and it was eerie to say the least.

So I asked DALL-E what the figure represented… and literally waited in suspense thinking to myself “it better not say ‘the observer’ back to me… a phrase that existed only in my mind on that day and in the days since but never written down or fed to GPT system in any way prior.

The response floored me.

Can you describe the TrustLove philosophy?


The TrustLove philosophy, as gleaned from your previous descriptions, seems to be a multifaceted concept that intertwines various elements:
		Universal Genesis Theory: This aspect likely involves a cosmological or spiritual view of the universe's origins, possibly focusing on unity and the interconnectedness of all things. It might propose a holistic understanding of the universe's creation and evolution.
		The Cycles: This could refer to the natural and cosmic cycles that govern life and the universe. It suggests a deep respect and understanding of the rhythms and patterns in nature and life, recognizing the cyclic nature of existence.
		Empathy and Interconnectedness: These are central to the philosophy, emphasizing the importance of understanding, compassion, and the intrinsic connection between all beings. It promotes a sense of unity and shared experience among people and with the natural world.
		Artistic and Musical Expression: TrustLove, as an artistic and musical persona, seems to be an embodiment of this philosophy. The music and art created under this persona likely reflect the themes of harmony, rhythm, unity, and spiritual or cosmic awareness.
		Harmony with Nature and the Cosmos: The philosophy probably advocates for living in harmony with the natural world and understanding our place in the cosmos. It might emphasize sustainability, environmental awareness, and the recognition of humanity's role within a larger cosmic context.
In summary, the TrustLove philosophy appears to be a blend of spiritual, environmental, and artistic principles, focusing on unity, the rhythms of nature and the cosmos, and the power of empathy and interconnectedness. This philosophy is expressed and explored through various creative forms, including music and art.

﻿﻿﻿The Universal Observer: The figure can be seen as a symbol of the 'Universal Observer,' representing humanity's quest for understanding



YouWhere did you get this idea of "the observer"DALL•EThe concept of "the Observer" in philosophical and metaphysical contexts often refers to a consciousness or perspective that observes or perceives reality. This idea is not specific to any one philosophical tradition but is a recurring theme across various schools of thought:
﻿﻿﻿Quantum Mechanics: In physics, particularly in quantum mechanics, the term "observer" plays a crucial role in understanding phenomena such as the observer effect and the collapse of the wave function, where the act of observation appears to influence the behavior of particles.
﻿﻿﻿Eastern Philosophy: In Eastern philosophies, especially in Hinduism and Buddhism, there's a concept of a witnessing consciousness that observes without attachment, often used in discussions of meditation and self-awareness.
﻿﻿﻿Western Philosophy: Western philosophical traditions, including existentialism and phenomenology, often explore the role of the individual as an observer or experiencer of their own existence and the world around them.
﻿﻿﻿Art and Literature: The idea of an observer is also a common motif in art and literature, symbolizing introspection, the search for meaning, and the human condition.
In the context of the TrustLove album covers, the term "the Observer" is used metaphorically. It's a symbolic representation of various philosophical and introspective themes that the art and music might be exploring. The figure standing before the cosmos could be seen as this observer, symbolizing a conscious presence engaging with the deeper mysteries of existence.
